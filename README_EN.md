## Cowork Mode Launched (2026-01-13) — Local Folder Task Assistant

**Cowork is all about “local folder tasks”: Authorize folder → Plan → Execute → Progress report → Deliverables.**

Think of it as letting AI work inside a folder you choose: organize, extract, summarize, and generate lists/spreadsheets/reports — and when useful, produce a lightweight tool/page to make the workflow reusable.

**Known-good, batteries included: 4 built-in Cowork Skills to turn folders into deliverables (lists / tables / reports / structured data).**

**4 Built-in Cowork Skills Templates:**
- ✅ **Local Folder Cleanup**: archive by rules, batch rename, generate a structured directory
- ✅ **Invoices & Expense Pack**: extract fields from files/images/text, generate expense reports and summary tables
- ✅ **Contract Triage**: batch process contracts, extract key terms/clauses, output checklists and summaries
- ✅ **Resume Triage**: batch process resumes, extract candidate fields, output structured tables and screening results

**Download the latest release to try Cowork Mode now!** (macOS / Windows installers available)

**Typical workflow:**
- **Input:** a messy folder
- **Process:** cleanup + extraction + summarization
- **Output:** lists/spreadsheets/reports (e.g., expense packs / candidate lists / contract highlights) + optional tool/page

## What is Goodable?

Goodable is a Cowork-first Desktop Agent for office work.

It specializes in local files and documents: organizing, extracting information, and producing deliverables — with optional programming capability to turn repeated workflows into reusable tools/pages.

## Positioning & Comparison

Goodable takes a “desktop delivery” approach: office deliverables first, and code/tool building when needed.

- **Cowork-style local office tools**: focus on “file organization and information extraction within authorized folders.” Goodable’s **Cowork Mode** is built around this paradigm, with cross-platform desktop capabilities and a path to templates + deployment.
- **Web-based AI tools** (Coze, Manus, Lovable, Base44, etc.): great for “click and get pages,” but constrained by browser sandboxing — limited local access and deeper workflows.
- **Developer IDE/coding assistants** (Cursor, TRAE, Qoder, Claude Code): powerful, but typically require dev environments, dependencies, and project structure — higher barrier for non-developers.
- **Goodable (our positioning)**: out-of-the-box desktop + Cowork-first office workflows + templates + one-click deployment. Friendly for non-technical users, while keeping engineering depth for advanced use.

---

## What Can You Do With It?

### Cowork Mode (Office Deliverables)
- Local folder cleanup, archiving, batch renaming, directory listing
- Receipts/invoices/expense extraction and summarization
- Contract batch triage and information extraction (checklists/summaries/structured fields)
- Resume batch triage and screening (structured tables/filtering results)
- (Continuously expanding) More Cowork Skills for office scenarios

### Tool/Page Packaging (Make Office Workflows Reusable)
When you want to turn a workflow into a reusable internal tool/page, use the built-in templates below:

- **Turn Coze workflows into websites** (coze2app)
- **Turn Feishu documents into websites** (Feishu Doc → Web)
- **One-click deploy to Alibaba Cloud + domain binding** (publish an accessible site in minutes)
- **Universal short video downloader** (covers major Chinese platforms)
- **WeChat group assistant bot** and other business templates
- Plus: a continuously updated library of production-ready source templates

---

## Core Features (Designed for Non-Technical Users)

- **Out of the box**: built-in Node.js + Python runtime — minimal setup
- **One desktop agent, two kinds of tasks**: Cowork office deliverables + optional tool building (pages/scripts/automation)
- **Stronger generation/transformation**: integrated **Claude Agent SDK** for real-world task execution and maintenance
- **Template marketplace**: one-click import; continuous updates and new templates
- **One-click deployment**: Alibaba Cloud deploy + domain binding — turn “runs locally” into “online and accessible”
- **Engineering-grade**: templates are not demos; they are production-ready skeletons for customization and delivery

<details>
<summary><b>Engineering & Core Architecture (For Technical Users)</b></summary>

- **Claude Agent SDK**: streaming output, controllable sessions and tool invocations
- **Multiple concurrent projects**: task queue, concurrent scheduling, process-level isolation
- **Stability**: process synchronization locks, re-entry protection, exception recovery
- **Multi-instance capability**: multi-window/multi-workspace parallel operation
- **IDE-like interface**: chat + file tree + console + preview (similar to Manus multi-view)
- **Plan mode**: plan first, execute later (extensible to multi-agent orchestration)
- **Progress visualization**: task steps, state transitions, real-time display
- **On-prem / local deployment**: controllable source, local data/runtime, deployable in enterprise intranet
- **Optional API/Web service**: expose the same capabilities as Web services or APIs (developer-oriented)

  * One-click generate and deploy: Android / iOS apps (planned)

* **Stronger “clone/refactor” capabilities**

  * One-click clone any website (inspired by open-lovable, but production engineering oriented)
  * Upgrade from “clone UI” to “clone capability + data structure + deployment architecture”

* **Template marketplace upgrade**

  * Reach **100 production-ready applications** (the “100agent” initiative: open source 100 agent/app templates)

* **Better non-technical experience**

  * Guided wizard for “one-click setup/keys/deploy”
  * Built-in diagnostics and repair (ports, dependencies, permissions, deployment failures)

* **Cowork Mode enhancements**

  * Expand office Cowork Skills (receipts/contracts/HR/material organization/meetings, etc.)
